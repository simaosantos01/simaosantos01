### :black_medium_square: Rest Api Project
Project developed within the scope of the Structured Information Processing course unit and consisted on the development of a REST API to help Santa Claus managing his visits to the factory. The API handles the submission of XML files with the necessary data to book a new visit to the factory, queries for getting the available slots during a time frame and the cancelation of a booked visit. All the data can be imported to mongo by executing a bash script and can be viewed on mongo charts.
