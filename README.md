### Hi there, I am SimÃ£o Santos ðŸ‘‹
At the moment, I am pursuing a degree in informatics engineering at ESTG-IPP and my passion is to build software!

## My Academic Projects :mortar_board:

### :black_medium_square: Oriented Object Programming Project
Project developed within the scope of the Programming Paradigms course unit, and consisted on the development of a Java API that is able to support the requirements of an environmental quality parameter monitoring tool, collected through various sensors installed at various control stations.

### :black_medium_square: Rest Api Project
Project developed within the scope of the Structured Information Processing course unit, and consisted on the development of a REST API to help Santa Claus managing his visits to the factory. The API handles the submission of XML files with the necessary data to book a new visit to the factory, queries for getting the available slots during a time frame and the cancelation of a booked visit. All the data can be imported to mongo by executing a bash script and can be viewed on mongo charts.

### :black_medium_square: Thread Synchronization Project
Project developed within the scope of the Operating Systems course unit, and consisted on the development of a Java application that makes use of multiprocessing, communication and synchronization techniques to emulate a car washing machine system.

### :black_medium_square: Data Structures Project
Project developed within the scope of the Data Structures course unit, and consisted on the development of a Java API that could handle the management of a merchant delivery company, mainly using graph theory to solve the problems associated when elaborating, the best performing distribution routes, for each worker.

### :black_medium_square: Web Development Project
Project developed within the scope of the web development course unit and consisted on the development of a books webstore from a client-server paradigm.
The software consists of two major components. First, the REST API is built on top of the MVC paradigm which will serve as a way of communication with the client side using requests and responses over the HTTP protocol, and the second as a client side application.

### :black_medium_square: Databases Project
Project developed within the scope of the databases course unit and consisted on the design and implementation of a restaurant database.
The database design follows carefully all the steps dictated on the book "Database Systems - A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation and Management" and for the implementation was used MSQL server.
